Deseret (<span class='autonym'>𐐔𐐯𐑅𐐨𐑉𐐯𐐻</span>) is a historical American bicameral alphabet, written left-to-right. Was used by members of the Church of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons) in Utah for writing the English language. Developed in 1854 by George D. Watt as part of a planned phonemic English-language spelling reform. Abandoned around 1877.
