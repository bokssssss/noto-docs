#### Yi

Yi (Modern Yi, <span class='autonym'>ꆈꌠꁱꂷ</span>) is an East Asian logo-syllabary, written horizontally left-to-right (modern) or vertically right-to-left (traditional). Used for the Nuosu Yi language (2 million users) in the Liangshan Yi region of China. Yi signs are made from five basic strokes; dot, horizontal line, vertical line, arch and circle. Attested 500 years ago, believed to be use for perhaps even 5000 years. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping).
