#### Sundanese

Sundanese (<span class='autonym'>ᮃᮊ᮪ᮞᮛ ᮞᮥᮔ᮪ᮓ</span>) is a Southeast Asian abugida, written left-to-right. The standard form (Aksara Sunda Baku, <span class='autonym'>ᮃᮊ᮪ᮞᮛ ᮞᮥᮔ᮪ᮓ ᮘᮊᮥ</span>) is used on the Indonesian island Java since 1996 for the Sundanese language (27 million speakers), and is derived from Old Sundanese script (Aksara Sunda Kuno, <span class='autonym'>ᮃᮊ᮪ᮞᮛ ᮞᮥᮔ᮪ᮓ ᮊᮥᮔ</span>) used in the 14th–18th centuries. The Sudanese language also uses Latin script. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping).
