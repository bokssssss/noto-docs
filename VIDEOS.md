> The Noto project is the most ambitious font project of all time, aiming to continually support 100 percent of all Unicode characters each year with fully functional fonts. Today, Noto offers fonts for 146 scripts and over 800 languages, and is opening the door to reading and writing for minority language speakers.
> 
> During the last decade, billions of people have found new options to communicate digitally in their preferred language or writing system, due in part to newly available fonts. According to UNESCO, “at least 43% of the estimated 6000 languages spoken in the world are endangered.” There are over 2.5 billion Android users globally, and as the default on Android, each Noto font enables a community’s culture to survive and thrive on the internet. For example, the Cherokee Nation in North America, with an estimated 20,000 speakers, uses Noto for texting, email, and teaching their language to the next generation.
> 
> Noto is used every day for Tibetan, Canadian indigenous languages, millions of African users, and hundreds of languages across Asia. According to UNESCO’s “Atlas of Languages in Danger,” 1,113 of the 2,572 languages reported are several and critically endangered and spoken primarily by community elders. Given age-related vision impairments, some of these speakers may have trouble reading small text sizes. When books, poetry, songs, and all kinds of texts are available in digital form; the ability to read minority languages fluently through the simple act of text magnification on-screen is important.
> 
> In this session, you will learn more about the most recently developed Noto variable fonts, their impact for endangered language communities and accessibility, and how you can contribute to the project to make reading truly universal.
> 
> Presentation by Susanna Zaraysky, Marek Jeziorek, and Dave Crossland, followed by Q&A with audience members.
> 
> Susanna Zaraysky is passionate about language learning and endangered language preservation. Zaraysky was the keynote speaker for the 2015 Foundation for Endangered Languages Conference on Music of Endangered Languages. Zaraysky made a documentary film, “Saved by Language,” about the endangered language of Ladino, and also held a TEDx talk on preserving endangered languages with music. She speaks eight languages and is the author of the book, “Language is Music,” focused on learning languages via music and the media. In 2014, Zaraysky participated in the International Mother Languages Day event, organized by the United Nations Academic Impact with school groups.

> Dave Crossland attended the first Libre Graphics Meeting in 2006, and became fascinated with the potential of libre licensing to improve design. Since then, he has worked to liberate typography, mainly as a program manager for Google Fonts. He also regularly contributes to the Crafting Type, Font Bakery, and Runebender projects.

## Just the all of us — how we developed our first Odia font family, the collaborative way

> Many typeface designers have the opportunity at some point to get out of the cave and open their eyes to a project outside of their comfort zone, outside of their daily design routine. That is where we found ourselves when we accepted a proposal to develop a font for the Odia script, a writing system in which we are not native. From the beginning, we understood that collaboration would be our best strategy to face this challenge; designing and producing a typeface in a writing system we do not know nor understand. The collaborative experience was extremely enriching and gave us a different perspective on our practice. However, we also encountered some limitations during that process. Our talk will shine a light on collaborative processes. We will present our typeface, Noto Sans Odia, through the prism of exchanges we had during the making of the project: communication between the designers, teamwork with the consultants, discussion with the software makers (Glyphs), etc. The collaboration between us all is what made the project possible.

> If we can’t see a language, does it exist? Of course it does, but in an increasingly computerized world, many languages remain invisible. Some languages have no writing system to be seen. Others are not necessarily accessible in the digital realm. What are the implications for these languages in light of today’s technologies? Computing in general is grounded in the assumption that spoken language can be transcribed and manipulated. But who are we leaving behind and why should we care? The benefits of digital representation aren’t limited to the locale of a particular language, script, or culture. The possibilities range from linguistic analysis to all forms of cross-referencing across disciplines like linguistics, history, archaeology, literature, sociology, economics, anthropology, and more. This presentation will look at a number of historic and minority writing systems and consider what can be gained by digitizing them and making them accessible to the world.

> Ambitious in its scope since its very beginning, the Noto project has aimed to provide fonts to support all the scripts in the Unicode Standard. The name “Noto” stands for “no tofu”—tofu being the square symbols that appear on the screen when a character isn’t supported by the font in use. By now in its seventh year, the Noto project is still active today. Over several stages, the project has supplied open-sourced fonts that support more than 120 scripts, both living and historical. What hidden infrastructure has made the Noto project feasible? What has made this a ripe moment for its fulfillment? In order to develop fonts for such a broad variety of scripts, one must pose many questions before attempting to find the answers. What style is most appropriate for this particular script? How do you make a font for a script that has no typographic history? Faced with competing styles, how do you settle on one of them? What if the historic record for a script is very sparse? Where do you find a script expert? What if there are no experts? Come join us as we explore some of these questions and share some interesting anecdotes about the Noto project.
> Kamal Mansour's Bio: An early multilingual education served to stimulate Kamal’s interest in languages, alphabets, and later on, typography. His studies have spanned Computer Science, Linguistics, and Product Design. Since the mid 1990s, Kamal has worked on the typography of many languages from around the globe. During that time, he has been involved in the development of the Unicode Standard which enables the digital support of all the world’s languages. In addition, he has extensively developed code necessary for the correct typographic shaping of many complex writing systems. Over the past 7 years, Kamal has played a leading role in the Google Noto Font project whose goal is to create fonts for all the languages of the world. Since 2006, he has served on the Board of Advisers of the Script Encoding Initiative of UC Berkeley. He has also taught a linguistics course at Stanford University entitled “Writing Systems in the Digital Age”.

> The Open Source Python Font Production Pipeline is a set of tools build by the open source community, including Google developers. It has been used by Google to produce Google's Noto font families. It can be used by anybody to automate their font production as well. The pipeline takes various inputs (e.g., \*.glyphs files) and compiles them into multiple binaries (\*.TTF and \*.OTF files among others). This presentation is about why Google wanted to have an open source font toolchain, how the toolchain (aka pipeline) was architected, engineered and debugged and how Google uses it to produce and validate Noto fonts.

> Noto is Google's own font that aims to support all languages in the world. Now it has supported almost all major living languages. For most languages, eight styles are supported: {regular, bold} x {normal, italic} x {sans serif, serif}. It is used by Android and Chrome OS as the default system fonts and is also recommended by Google's Material Design. What’s more important, Noto is open source and everyone can use it for free.  
>
> Using Noto is easy. If you are developing a mobile app, simply bundle the fonts with your app. If you are a website developer, use Noto fonts as Web Fonts. Many Noto fonts are available to use at Google Web Fonts Early Access. You can also host the fonts in your own server and specify them in web pages.
