> If we can’t see a language, does it exist? Of course it does, but in an increasingly computerized world, many languages remain invisible. Some languages have no writing system to be seen. Others are not necessarily accessible in the digital realm. What are the implications for these languages in light of today’s technologies? Computing in general is grounded in the assumption that spoken language can be transcribed and manipulated. But who are we leaving behind and why should we care? The benefits of digital representation aren’t limited to the locale of a particular language, script, or culture. The possibilities range from linguistic analysis to all forms of cross-referencing across disciplines like linguistics, history, archaeology, literature, sociology, economics, anthropology, and more. This presentation will look at a number of historic and minority writing systems and consider what can be gained by digitizing them and making them accessible to the world.

## The Noto Project

> Ambitious in its scope since its very beginning, the Noto project has aimed to provide fonts to support all the scripts in the Unicode Standard. The name “Noto” stands for “no tofu”—tofu being the square symbols that appear on the screen when a character isn’t supported by the font in use. By now in its seventh year, the Noto project is still active today. Over several stages, the project has supplied open-sourced fonts that support more than 120 scripts, both living and historical. What hidden infrastructure has made the Noto project feasible? What has made this a ripe moment for its fulfillment? In order to develop fonts for such a broad variety of scripts, one must pose many questions before attempting to find the answers. What style is most appropriate for this particular script? How do you make a font for a script that has no typographic history? Faced with competing styles, how do you settle on one of them? What if the historic record for a script is very sparse? Where do you find a script expert? What if there are no experts? Come join us as we explore some of these questions and share some interesting anecdotes about the Noto project.
> Kamal Mansour's Bio: An early multilingual education served to stimulate Kamal’s interest in languages, alphabets, and later on, typography. His studies have spanned Computer Science, Linguistics, and Product Design. Since the mid 1990s, Kamal has worked on the typography of many languages from around the globe. During that time, he has been involved in the development of the Unicode Standard which enables the digital support of all the world’s languages. In addition, he has extensively developed code necessary for the correct typographic shaping of many complex writing systems. Over the past 7 years, Kamal has played a leading role in the Google Noto Font project whose goal is to create fonts for all the languages of the world. Since 2006, he has served on the Board of Advisers of the Script Encoding Initiative of UC Berkeley. He has also taught a linguistics course at Stanford University entitled “Writing Systems in the Digital Age”.

Event: TYPO Labs 2017

> Behdad will talk about updates to the variable fonts building pipeline based on FontTools. Dominik provides an update on implementation progress of variable fonts in a development version of Chrome, including a live preview of variable fonts capabilities in the Chrome browser. He will also explain how you can start your own experiments with variable fonts in Chrome.

> Commissioned by Google, the ‘noto-hinted’ project (set up at github) was the driving force behind ttfautohint in the last two years.  The goal is to provide good automatic hinting for the Noto font family, covering a large set of scripts.  The talk describes the history and setup of the project, together with possible future enhancements.

## The Open Source Python Font Production Pipeline

> The Open Source Python Font Production Pipeline is a set of tools build by the open source community, including Google developers. It has been used by Google to produce Google's Noto font families. It can be used by anybody to automate their font production as well. The pipeline takes various inputs (e.g., \*.glyphs files) and compiles them into multiple binaries (\*.TTF and \*.OTF files among others). This presentation is about why Google wanted to have an open source font toolchain, how the toolchain (aka pipeline) was architected, engineered and debugged and how Google uses it to produce and validate Noto fonts.

> A typeface five years in the making, Google Noto spans more than 100 writing systems, 800 languages, and hundreds of thousands of characters. A collaborative effort between Google and Monotype, the Noto typeface is a truly universal method of communication for billions of people around the world accessing digital content.

> Noto is Google's own font that aims to support all languages in the world. Now it has supported almost all major living languages. For most languages, eight styles are supported: {regular, bold} x {normal, italic} x {sans serif, serif}. It is used by Android and Chrome OS as the default system fonts and is also recommended by Google's Material Design. What’s more important, Noto is open source and everyone can use it for free.  
>
> Using Noto is easy. If you are developing a mobile app, simply bundle the fonts with your app. If you are a website developer, use Noto fonts as Web Fonts. Many Noto fonts are available to use at Google Web Fonts Early Access. You can also host the fonts in your own server and specify them in web pages.
