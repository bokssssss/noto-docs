### Pahawh Hmong

Pahawh Hmong (𖬖𖬰𖬝𖬵 𖬄𖬶𖬟 𖬌𖬣𖬵) is an East Asian syllabary. Used in China, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand for the Hmong language (over 0.2 million speakers). The script as a whole is read left-to-right but each syllable is written right-to-left. Created in 1959 by Shong Lue. Hmong is also written in the Romanized Popular Alphabet by William Smalley.
