### Runic

Runic is a historical European alphabet, written left-to-right or boustrophedon. Used in Northern Europe in 150–1000 CE for Germanic languages. The Scandinavian variants are also called Futhark or Fuþark. Derived from Old Italic. Gradually replaced with the Latin script. Still used for specialized purposes, by occultist, mystic, and esoteric movements, and in fantasy literature.
