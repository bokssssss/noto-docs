### Buginese

Buginese (Lontara, ᨒᨚᨈᨑ) is a Southeast Asian abugida, written left-to-right. Was used since the 17th century for the Bugis, Makasar, and Mandar languages of Sulawesi in Indonesia (over 7 million speakers). Largely replaced by the Latin alphabet during the period of Dutch colonization, but still used for ceremonial, personal and traditional texts.
