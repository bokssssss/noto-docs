### Orkhon runic (Old Turkic)

Orkhon runic (Old Turkic) is a historical Central Asian alphabet, written right-to-left or boustrophedon. Was used in the 8th–13th centuries in Mongolia and Siberia for Turkic languages. Earliest examples discovered in 1889 on the banks of the Orkhon river. Superficially similar to Germanic runes and to Old Hungarian.
