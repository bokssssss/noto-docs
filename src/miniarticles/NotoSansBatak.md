### Batak

Batak (ᯘᯮᯒᯖ᯲ ᯅᯖᯂ᯲) is a Southeast Asian abugida, written vertically and horizontally left-to-right. Used for the Toba, Karo, Dairi, Mandailing, Simalungun, and Angkola languages used on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Used since the 14th century, standardised in the 1850s. Revived recently after a decline since in the 20th century.
