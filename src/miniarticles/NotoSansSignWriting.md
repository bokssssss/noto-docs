### SignWriting

SignWriting (Sutton SignWriting) is a featural Sign-Language script, written vertically and horizontally left-to-right. Used to transcribe some 12 sign languages like Brazilian Sign Language, French Sign Language, Norwegian Sign Language, American Sign Language, Danish Sign Language, and for International Sign. Developed in 1974 by Valerie Sutton, later standardized as the International Sign Writing Alphabet (ISWA). The visually iconic symbols represent the hands, face and body, arranged spatially to reflect the movements made by the signer. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping).
