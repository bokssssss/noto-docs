### Imperial Aramaic

Imperial Aramaic is a historical Middle Eastern abjad, written right-to-left. Was the script and language of the Persian Empire in 5thâ€“3rd century BCE. Derived from the Phoenician script. Continued to be used until the 2nd century CE, and later evolved into Syriac, Nabataean, Palmyran and Hebrew (to which it is the closest).
