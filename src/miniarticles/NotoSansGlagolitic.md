### Glagolitic

Glagolitic (Glagolitsa, Ⰳⰾⰰⰳⱁⰾⰹⱌⰰ) is a historical European bicameral alphabet, written left-to-right. Created around  863 CE, traditionally attributed to Saint Cyril, a monk from Thessaloniki working in Bulgaria. The oldest known Slavic alphabet. Was used throughout the Balkans in tandem with the later-created Cyrillic until the 13th century, after which time it was largely replaced by Cyrillic. In Croatia, Glagolitic continued to be used until the 19th century, particularly in the church. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping).
