### Canadian Aboriginal syllabics

Canadian Aboriginal syllabics is a family of American abugidas, written left-to-right (0.5 million users). Used for Cree languages, for Inuktitut (co-official with the Latin script in the territory of Nunavut), for Ojibwe, Blackfoot. Were also used for Dakelh (Carrier), Chipewyan, Slavey, Tłı̨chǫ (Dogrib) and Dane-zaa (Beaver). Created in 1840 by James Evans to write several indigenous Canadian languages. Primarily used in Canada, occasionally in the United States.
