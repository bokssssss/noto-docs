### Nabataean

Nabataean is a historical Middle Eastern abjad, written right-to-left. Was used in northern Arabia and the southern Levant in the 2nd century BCE–4th century CE for the Nabataean language. Derived from Aramaic, evolved into the Arabic script. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping).
