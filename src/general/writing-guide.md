## “Noto fonts” vs. “the Noto fonts”

1. Use “Noto fonts” when you mean any or some of the fonts from the Noto collection. Example: “Noto fonts use Unicode”, “Use Noto fonts on the web.” Analogy: “people”.
2. Use “the Noto fonts” when your text specifically identifies them, i.e. when you could replace “the” with “those”. Example: “Drag the Noto fonts you downloaded into the folder.”. Analogy: “The people you saw.”
3. Use “the Noto fonts” when you use it as a collective noun, i.e. when you could replace “the Noto fonts” with “all Noto fonts” or “the Noto font collection”. Example: “The Noto fonts support all of Unicode 12”. Analogy: “The people vs. John Smith.”
4. Consider using “all” instead of “the” when you want to underline that the sentence really applies to all Noto fonts. Example: “All Noto fonts are licensed under the SIL Open Font License.”
5. Use “the Noto collection” or “the Noto font collection” or “the Noto project” if you mean not just the fonts but also the website, documentation, development processes etc.
